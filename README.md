# QuotonEngine
Work in progress. 2D Game engine using raylib-lua, meant to be used in [Quoton](https://github.com/JeremyGamer13/Quoton) once released.

Feel free to use it for your own work but do note some scripts (specifically AudioService, FileService, and FontService) are unstable/unusable in release builds.
